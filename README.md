📊 Interactive Sales Performance Dashboard (Excel)

This repository contains the methodology and final Excel file for a comprehensive, interactive sales performance dashboard. The goal of this project was to transform raw sales data into a visually compelling and dynamic business intelligence tool, enabling users to analyze key metrics, track trends, and measure year-over-year (YoY) growth instantly.

The dashboard features a modern, dark-themed design (as shown in the project image) and utilizes advanced Excel features like Pivot Tables, calculated fields, and Slicers for seamless interaction.

✨ Key Features & Methodology

The dashboard was built following a structured process, from data preparation to final aesthetic design:

1. Data Preparation & Engineering

Dataset Cleaning and Structuring: Ensured the raw transaction data was clean and optimized for analysis.

Calculated Columns: Added essential helper columns, specifically Month and Year, to facilitate temporal analysis and grouping within Pivot Tables.

2. Core Data Modeling (Pivot Tables)

Pivot Table Creation: Built multiple robust Pivot Tables to summarize data for key metrics (Sales, Quantity, Cost, Profit, Regional Distribution, Product Sales).

Calculated Fields: Utilized Pivot Table calculated fields to derive new metrics necessary for high-level summaries.

3. Financial Analysis & Metrics

Year-over-Year (YoY) Growth: Implemented complex Excel functions (e.g., GETPIVOTDATA or specific time intelligence functions depending on the Excel version) to accurately calculate YoY growth percentages for all key performance indicators (KPIs) like Sales, Quantity, and Profit.

4. Wireframing & Design

Design Inspiration: A professional wireframe was designed based on Pinterest inspiration, focusing on data density, visual hierarchy, and modern aesthetics.

Thematic Design: Adopted a dark-themed color palette to enhance the visual appeal and highlight the data points.

5. Interactive Dashboard Creation

Visual Layout: Created a multi-panel dashboard utilizing various chart types (line graphs for trend, bar charts for breakdown, and KPI cards).

Slicers, Icons, and Labels: Integrated Slicers for filtering by category (e.g., "Accessories," "Electronics"), Year, and Region. Used modern icons and clear labels to elevate the user experience.

Linked Navigation: All dashboard elements, including charts and KPIs, are dynamically linked to the Slicers and to each other, ensuring that a single selection updates all visuals instantly.

🛠️ Technology Used

Software: Microsoft Excel (2016 or newer recommended)

Core Features: Pivot Tables, Slicers, Conditional Formatting, Advanced Formulas (e.g., GETPIVOTDATA, IFERROR), Named Ranges.

🚀 How to Use the Dashboard

Download: Clone this repository or download the Sales_Dashboard_Final.xlsx file.

Open: Open the file in Microsoft Excel.

Interact: Navigate to the Dashboard sheet. Use the Slicers at the top or on the sides to filter the data.

Click on a Category (e.g., "Accessories") to see performance metrics specific to that segment.

The Monthly Revenue Trend chart and all KPI cards will update in real-time.

Analysis: Review the YoY growth metrics on the KPI cards to instantly identify areas of strong or weak performance compared to the prior year.
